# `exports` is a required field available in every module.
# Its purpose is to specify files to be placed somewhere other than the default location.
# `exports` should be a list of objects with `source` and `target` keys.
# The `source` field contains the name of the file.
# The `target` field contains the destination path.
# The default location is $HOME/.config/$MODULE_NAME.
# If you do not wish to export any files, leave `exports` empty or set it to null.
exports:
  - source: "foo"
    target: "bar"

# `include` is an optional field available in every module.
# It should be a list of objects with `module` and `path` keys.
# The `module` field contains the name of the module to include.
# The `path` field contains the relative path to the directory containing that module.
include:
  - module: "whiskey"
    path: "tango"

# `templates` is an optional field available in every module.
# Templates have an open structure and can be nested arbitrarily.
# To create templates, simply add them to the `templates` mapping.
# For example, { eta: { tau: "phi" } } can be accessed in code with:
# !(eta.tau)! (rendered to `phi`)
# You can replace !( and )! with whatever delimiters you define in your `global.yaml`.
templates:
  eta:
    tau: "phi"
