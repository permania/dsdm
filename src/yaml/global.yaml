# Global templates available in every module.
# Good for things you reuse like colors and fonts.
templates:
  colors:
    base00: "FFFFFF"
    # ... #
  fonts:
    foreground: "Maple Mono"
    secondary: "VictorMono Nerd Font"
    # Add more values at your discretion.
# Apply with the global prefix:
# !( global.fonts.foreground )!

  # Sets the delimiters for templates.
  # The default is "!(" and ")!", resulting in strings like, "!( global.fonts.foreground )!".
  # Try values like "{{" and "}}" or "<%" and "%>", or whatever pleases you.
delimiters:
  open: "!("
  close: ")!"
